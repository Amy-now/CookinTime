Introduction
Cookin time has been developed with the aim of aiding students and young people in improving their diet and cooking skills.
This app was built with React and adheres to the standards of modern apps using professional tools and techniques. Due to a lack of knowledge and time constraints certain features have not been implemented to the degree that I would want for example the favourites button. Testing with a small group of representative users has yielded positive results. The application includes a collection of easy and quick recipes, a search function, step by step instructions for preparation and a recipe generator, allowing users to cut down on food waste, as well as make meals with ingredients they already have allowing them to save money as they don’t have to keep going out to buy more food. These features may improve cooking skills and enjoyment for young people, also it is hoped to increase the frequency of cooking as it becomes easier.
Methodology
 
 (Adam, 2021)
Initially when looking at methodologies I considered using Agile however on further scrutiny  I established that waterfall may be a better fit this was some of my reasoning:
Agile is useful in getting projects delivered in a short space of time but this is more important than documentation, obviously as part of an assignment the predictability, fixed timeline and well documented predictability of waterfall fits better. The fact that Cookin Time is relying on recipe and implementation times that are already existing also means that waterfall works better than Agile where the project's features are all worked out in an iterative manner.

Agile allows more flexibility in the process enabling adaptations of opportunities as the project unfolds. This would not fit well with assignment deadlines.The waterfall method was beneficial as it meant that with the small time frame available the tasks could be broken down into small chunks, therefore setting deliverable dates, start/end dates and tracking my process was much easier. One of the downsides with waterfall is the fact that each section is supposed to be completed prior to moving on to the next. In this project the development phase was not totally complete (favourite button and changing of email and password details) but  I was very aware of possible deadline creep  and in order to complete the assignment moved on to testing although recognising that this is not standard when using the Waterfall model.  Overall Waterfall is more effective when a project has constraints such as time, or cost and the requirements and scope are well understood (such as an assignment).

The first assessment had already covered Requirements, Analysis and Design. Here we will be concentrating on the Develop and  Test stages with Maintenance being a future development. (Nowak, n.d.)(Parsons, 2019)

 
Methods
To allow our web application to be tested, user interviews were conducted with 8 users from our target audience (students and young adults).  ‘Talk-out-loud’ sessions assisted us in understanding how users might use the app, identify potential gaps and discover “pain-points” in the project. Although survey and questionnaires may be less time consuming, the indepth results obtained by speaking face to face with users cannot be undervalued.
The user interview was approximately 15 minutes followed by a survey. Initially we observed the user interaction with the app, identifying if they struggled with any particular element as well as how they moved around the screens. An online questionnaire was distributed after the session containing questions about their experience with the app, whether they would consider using it in the future and if they thought it could make a difference in the issues of diet and cooking skills in students and young people.
Due to the time constraints, it was only possible to base our conclusion on the opinion of the testers whereas a wider study of how likely Cookin Time is to solve the stated issues would be beneficial.

Conclusion/Results

The overwhelming consensus from user testing was very positive. Both the talk out loud sessions and survey help support the idea that this application is useful and does  help solve the issue around students and young people  improving their diet and cooking skills.
All participants were able register or login using their google account to access the application. It is then possible to browse the collection of recipes or search for specific ones using the search bar.
They then moved to the single recipe page view which shows ingredients and instructions for the chosen recipe.  The user can adjust the serving size as needed and see a step by step instruction guide of the recipe. Pages such as recipe generator, profile page and favourites can all be accessed by the navigation bar, located at the bottom of the page.
To support testing users were allocated simple tasks ie “Search for Chocolate Brownies,” “Find recipes containing potatoes for someone with a peanut allergy” and finally “Sign out”. All users were able to complete these tasks without issue and in a timely manner. This was seen as a reassuring sign that the design is clear and working well.
Directly after the talk out loud session the users were given a survey to complete. This was so that the website and tasks would be fresh in their minds and hopefully improve their answers. The survey was written with the knowledge that the favourites page and buttons were not working.
The survey highlighted some important issues for improvement. We can see that people really liked the recipe generator and the volume of different recipes available however few users liked the overall design of the application
 
 
The theme of design lacking was identified in the talk out loud sessions as well as the survey.
Users comments:
Could be a sleeker design. It feels a little outdated and clunky
Loved the large selection of recipes there are. The website is a little slow but it's still usable.
Although I like the overall design I think certain aspects can be changed. For example: there is far too much drop shadow on the components and the font is quite small considering all the white space there is.

The colour palette, although consistent, isn't very nice. But the functionality of the application is really good
Tons of great recipes available. It would be good to see some more filter options. Although you can search for them it would be good to have suggestions eg: drinks, desserts
it would have been nice to have a more modern cooking app
A great selection of recipes and drinks for all occasions
I could see this really helping me cook more food and different type of food in my house. 
I like how clear and simple it is to use. I don't see how it is just for students though
Love that i can change how many servings i have and the ingredients change accordingly
It would be nice to be able to change the measurement units for the recipes
Table of user comments during talk out loud sessions
One of our survey questions related to usability and ease of navigation of the application. It was clear that none of the users struggled with the usability, this was not overally surprising as the target audience is students and young people who are very used to using technology in their daily lives. It is good however to have data that backs this up.

 
 
Although the assignment did not allow time for the maintenance stage of waterfall methodology, the users were still asked about any improvements that could be made to the app. Six users expressed they would like to add recipes to a shopping list as well as share recipes they find with other people.
 
The analysis phase (included in AE1) revealed a need for an app that helps students manage their nutrition and improve their planning and cooking skills. Cookin Time appears to be an effective solution to this. Feedback from talk-out-loud sessions and surveys confirmed the app's balance of functionality and user interface style. The app's minimal design and emphasis on key features make it usable and accessible to most individuals with a smartphone or internet access.
Although functional, the web application at present would be considered a MVP (Minimal Viable Product). There are a number of improvements that could be made such as getting the favourites page to work and adding a loading screen) as well as extra features that could be added (sharing recipes and a shopping list). Following feedback from the user group the overall design would also be revamped to make it more appealing. 
Particularly interesting was the feedback from a user who expressed they “did not see how the app would specifically support students” thinking about this moving forward the plan would be to include a pricing element into the recipes so they could be filtered by price. This would certainly make it more applicable to students who struggle with finances.
Overall a stronger knowledge of React and better time management could have resulted in a more complete piece of work, however based on the results from our study Cookin Time has a good possibility of being a solution to the poor diet and lack of cooking skills in students.
